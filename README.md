# Hackathon-Practice
My university is trying to start a hackathon team, and I will be putting all of my practice problems under this repository.



# Dutch National Flag problem (DNFprob.go)
Given an array containing only 0’s, 1’s, and 2’s, sort it in linear time and using constant space.

The trick was all in the 3 for loops I used in the function to build the array.
This method could be used to solve any sorting problem where the elements in the array are known.
